# DreamGigs
This repository holds both the front end and backend applications of a gig-services recommender platform, focused on building employability for residents in Low-SES areas. The app currently can only be deployed locally with Flask.

# Installation
#### 1. Flask
The backend consists of two flask servers, one on port 5000 and the other on port 8000. If you don't have it already, you'll want to install flask with the following command:
```sh
$ pip install flask
```
# Running
To run the application, you'll want to navigate to the webapp directory and classifier directory separately, and enter the following:
```sh
$ python app.py
```

Navigate now to localhost:8000 in your browser, and the app should be ready to go!
